    "The common-emitter amplifier can be used to achieve high levels of voltage gain in analog circuits. However, gain can be affected by loading at both at the input and output of the amplifier, so we need to ensure that minimal loading occurs when the amplifier is connected to a sensor or other circuit blocks. In addition, the bandwidth over which the maximum gain can be achieved is limitied by the presence of capacitance, which results in loading at higher frequencies (away from DC).\n",
