    " - To understand the impact of different noise sources in a circuit and how they affect the achievement of performance targets (e.g. SNR)\n",
    " - To understand how to choose components and apply gain and filtering to optimize for SNR, power dissipation, and cost\n",

    "Many sensor systems employ analog multiplexing, a technique in which more than one sensor output is processed by a single ADC. Multiplexing reduces the overall component count and cost by sharing components between multiple sensor “channels”. Because the ADC samples multiple inputs, the sampling frequency needs to be higher than the case where the ADC only converts a single channel. To first order, the sampling frequency of the ADC should be at least N times higher than the Nyquist frequency, where N is the number of sensor channels. "
