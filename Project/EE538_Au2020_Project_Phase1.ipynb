    " - To understand how to translate application specifications (e.g. dynamic range of a sensor output) into circuit specifications\n",
    " - To understand the impact of different noise sources in a circuit and how they affect the achievement of performance targets (e.g. SNR)\n",
    " - To understand how to choose components and apply gain and filtering to optimize for SNR, power dissipation, and cost\n",
